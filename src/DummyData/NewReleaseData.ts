    title: "As It Was",
    description:
      "The lead single from Harry Styles’ third album balances its agitated inner monologue, where the shape-shifting pop star picks at the details of a relationship in crisis, with spun-sugar synths that give cover to his torment. From its playful opening — Styles’ goddaughter Ruby giggling “Go on, Harry, we want to say goodnight to you!” — to its singsong bridge, during which Styles’ thoughts are ping-ponging around his head at “high-speed internet” velocities, “As It Was” paints an unusually vivid picture. Everything might seem fine on first glance, but it all becomes more troubling (“What kind of pills are you on?”) with each repeated glimpse.",

      "“We did it because my career was on the wane and we wanted something to make a hit,” Harry Nilsson bluntly told an interviewer when asked why he covered Badfinger’s near-despondent ballad: “I heard it and searched through every Beatles album for two and a half weeks, trying to find out which one of their tunes it was.” Producer Richard Perry agreed, piling on the strings to showcase Nilsson’s desperate lunge of a vocal. Both were right — the song went to Number One and earned a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.",

      "The holy mother of all diss tracks, “You’re So Vain” contains one of the most enduring musical mysteries of all time. Just who is so vain that he probably thinks the song is about him? Simon previously revealed that actor Warren Beatty inspired the second verse of the song (“Oh, you had me several years ago/When I was still naive”), but speculation abounds regarding the other man (or men) behind the ire. Either way, the track — boasting omnipresent Seventies arranger Paul Buckmaster’s orchestration and Mick Jagger’s background vocals — is pure soft-rock fire.",

If you do a ballad first, and then a rocker, that doesn’t work.” Her instincts were right: Following the jaunty “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” “Time” became her first Number One.",

      "Between saving fans from jobsworth security guards on the Eras Tour, re-recording her third studio album, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), and dating a semi-problematic frontman, Taylor Swift has found time to release three new songs as part of ‘Midnights (Til Dawn Edition).’ ‘Hits Different’, from 2022, is the danceable heartbreak hit, detailing her breakup from boyfriend of six years, Joe Alwyn (sob). It’s both melodramatic and teenage angsty, stuffed with slogan tee lines like ‘I pictured you with other girls in love, then threw up on the street’ as she skims over past relationships. But the lyric ‘you were the one that I loved, don't need another metaphor’ has the emotional maturity of a woman secure  in her own truth, levelheadedly accepting the end without blame or malice. It’s melancholy, nostalgic, upbeat and a relatable tale for recently single gals. Queen Tay strikes the bullseye again.",
